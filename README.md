# Project-4
## Analysis of parent's impact on student performance by using a small and simple data.
#### The main file used to perform Explanatory Data Analysis : School.csv
#### The data was from the webscite : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/856/higher+education+students+performance+evaluation

## Here's some grneral lookthrough for all the files present: 
### School.csv : 
#### The original data file which was numerically codded and needed to perform EDA.
### MILESTONE-1 : 
#### A word document containing a quick lookthrough what is happening in the project.
### MILESTONE-2 : 
#### A python notebook where I performed Explanatory data analysis and then exported the cleaned file, student.csv out.
#### the values were numerically codded and i had to convert those values into a string values that was exported as a new file.
### student.csv:
#### The csv file that was exported after performing EDA in MILESTONe-2 python Notebook
### MILESTONE-3 : 
#### A seperate notebook file for choosing a new dataframe for graphical purposes
#### I have exported the final dataframe I used for MILESTONE-4 as a seperate .csv file named new_student.csv
### new_student.csv : 
#### An exported subset of student.csv that was obtained through MILESTONE-3 Python Notebook
### MILESTONE-4 : 
#### A file containing a the graphical part of the whole project
#### It contains an graphical answering of the questions asked in MILESTONE-1
### FINAL_Project: 
#### A Spare file where I performed my Rough work for understanding of the Dataset
